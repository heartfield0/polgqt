        <h1>How to Play</h1>
        <h2>Mechanics</h2>
        <p>The game begins with a blank 3x3 grid. Before starting the game, players are required to input their names. The first player will be referred to as Player 1 and the second player as Player 2. Player 1 will use the 1 marker, while Player 2 will use the 0 marker. Players take turns to place their marker on the grid, with Player 1 going first. A marker can be placed in any of the nine squares, as long as it is not already occupied by another marker.</p>
        <h2>Rules and Regulations</h2>
        <p>The game is won when a player has three of their markers in a row, column, or diagonal on the grid. If all squares are filled and no player has achieved this condition, the game is a draw. Players cannot skip their turn or place their marker in a square that is already occupied. If a player is found to be cheating or breaking the rules, they will automatically forfeit the game. The game ends once a winner is declared or the game is a draw. Players can choose to start a new game after the current game ends.</p>
